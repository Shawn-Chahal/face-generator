# Face Generator

This repository trains a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty on the [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) dataset using [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) in Python. The generator model is then used in the [Face Generator](https://www.shawnchahal.com/face-generator) web app.

## What does the app do?

[Face Generator](https://www.shawnchahal.com/face-generator) is a web app where the user is shown faces which have been generated using a Generative Adversarial Network. The user can then select as many faces as they'd like to generate a new composite face.
